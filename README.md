Hello everyone,

This github branch is dedicated to my personal project where I look to create a physics simulation that uses Verlet Integration and Procedural animation with a soft body.


Right now you can see the word document I am in the process of gradually filling out, it is unfinished but is receiving gradual updates.


You can also notice that I am working on creating a simple working system (SWS) to slowly add more functionality to it with time.


I wanted to be specific with it, and I want it to be modular, so we have files such as:

particle.py - this handles anything related to the Particle class

window.py - this handles anything with creating the tkinter window

main.py - this file is the main entry point to the program, as well as handling any simulation and rendering.
